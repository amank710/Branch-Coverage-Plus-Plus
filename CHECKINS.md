Use this file to commit information clearly documenting your check-ins' content. If you want to store more information/details besides what's required for the check-ins that's fine too. Make sure that your TA has had a chance to sign off on your check-in each week (before the deadline); typically you should discuss your material with them before finalizing it here.

# Check-in 1

### Current Project Ideas

1. Program that finds memory leaks in C code (scope might be too wide)
2. VSCode extension to auto type python files
3. Program to check memory usage of any executable
4. Time Complexity Analyser -> Gives the Big O Time and Space Complexity from a file
5. Loop Error Checker -> Checks if a loops will have index out of bound error
6. Static checker to ensure if all brances are usable
7. Dynamic Analysis: Monitor memory allocation and deallocation at runtime to detect memory leaks in C++/C
8. Static Analysis: analyse code to calculate whatever some relevant metrics would be for complexity (e.g. number of dependencies)
9. Syntax highlighter vscode extension that also checks loop out of bound errors

### Discussions with the TA

1. Next project's program analysis has to involve some sort of control flow analysis
2. Visualization doesn't have to be too substantional (eg. vs code plugin to annotate python types)

### Follow up Tasks

1. Talk to TA about ideas
2. Look at libraries (that instructors will post on piazza about) which can provide the AST for a language. This is to decide which specific languages we can work on.
